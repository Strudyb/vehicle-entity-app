# vehicle-entity-app
This app created using by Vue.js. Vue preferred over other frameworks because it has good features from React and Angular, on my thought it's less complex than them.
Also i've worked as a professional with Vue in two large projects. So my infrastructure is better in Vue than other frameworks. I kept this project clear and clean as i can.
I used supabase as backend service for mock data. Lodash is used for check data equality and deep clone functions. No other library used in the project.
